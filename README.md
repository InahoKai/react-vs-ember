The code in this repo provides runnable examples of code throughout a blogging series comparing react (and it's ecosystem) with ember.

The structure is the following:

```
 - blog-topic/
   - react/
     - everything needed to run a react project
   - ember/
     - everything needed to run an ember project

```
each react/ember folder will have a `README.md` which explains which files are of relevance for the specific blog topic.
